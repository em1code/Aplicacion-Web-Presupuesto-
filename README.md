# Aplicacion-Web-Presupuesto-
Budget web app. This is a practice exercise I did in a Udemy course.
This application allows the user to enter income and expenditure type data, and get the budget. As well as the total percentage of discharge. 
These data that we enter have 2 properties which are "description" and "value". 
The application also allows the user to delete the data entered by pressing the "x" icon. 
The budget is constantly updated.
